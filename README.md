Changing HB0020 badge sketch to work on HB0050 badge

I changed the pins on the old sketch to match the pinouts on the new badge.
One thing I can't seem to get work is to have pin 16 (the third button) be the mute button.  
I'm not familiar with interrupts, especially in a more complex sketch like this.  Any suggestions would be welcome.
